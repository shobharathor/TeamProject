## Features

**Become A Partner Page:**

1. There are 9 sections on the partner page, including a footer and a header.
2. Tags used:
   - Semantic tags - nav, footer, main, section, etc.
3. Additionally, social media icons have been incorporated into the page.
4. Flex Grid Usage and Center Alignment:
   - I have used Flex Grid on my webpage.
   - Center alignment has been applied to everything, ensuring that the content is centered.
5. Responsive Design Settings:
   - I have set the page to be responsive for lesser than 375, 375, 768, 1024, and larger than 1024.
   - This ensures that the page will display correctly when viewed on desktops, tablets, or mobile devices.
6. Relevant class names:
   - I have used easy-to-understand class names, allowing for consistent styling across different sections.
   - This approach keeps the code organized and provides specific styles to each section.

 **Learning:**
   - Use class names efficiently.
   - Use extensions like pesticide and font-finder.
   - Collaborate effectively using GitHub for teamwork.
   - Implement media queries and animations.
