## Getting Started

[First, the captain created a GitHub account under the name of the team project. Then, we added all team members as collaborators. Everyone explored the AngelOne site in a meeting.]

## Features
 **Home Page (Captain):**
  1. there are 13 sections on the home page, including a footer and a header.
  2. Two sections utilize a grid layout, and one section is designed in the form style.
  3. Additionally, social media icons have been incorporated into the page.
  4. Flex Grid Usage and Center Alignment:
     4.1. I have used Flex Grid on my webpage.
     Center alignment has been applied to everything, ensuring that the content is centered.
  5. Responsive Design Settings:
     5.1. I have set the page to be responsive up to 1024 and 768.
     This ensures that the page will display correctly when viewed on desktops, tablets, or mobile devices.
 6. Class-based Grid Structure:
    6.1. I have structured the grid based on classes, creating a different layout for each section.
      This approach keeps the code organized and gives each section a specific style.

 - [Technologies Used]
   1. VS code
